# Networking Reports

In this repository I have my 4 reports made in the second semester of Computer Engineering Graduation.
These reports where evaluated with a 18.25 out of 20 grade in my pratical aspect of the "Computer Networking" class.

On the first part I was aiming to study the behavior of HTTP Server and Clients. I used XAMPP/Apache as a web server first and our browser as client. After that i've made a HTTP Client in Kotlin without using any HTTP Libraries to replace the browser.
Finally we sent some requests using both (browser client and kotlin client) and captured it using WireShark to analyze the server-client communication.

After that we just had to configure a small LAN network being careful with Networking Rules.

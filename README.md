## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the reports for four project phases undertaken during the "Computer Networking" class. These projects involved developing an HTTP/s client, configuring a small LAN network, and analyzing network traffic. Each report is located in its respective directory.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: HTTP/s Client in Kotlin

In the first phase, we developed an HTTP/s client using Kotlin. The project involved setting up an XAMPP/Apache server to make HTTP/s requests. We then analyzed these requests using Wireshark to understand the network traffic and protocols involved.

### Phase 2: Configuring a Small LAN Network

In the second phase, we started configuring a small LAN network. This phase involved setting up basic network infrastructure and ensuring connectivity between devices.

### Phase 3: Base Networking Topology

In the third phase, we focused on connecting multiple networks using routers. This included configuring routers to manage traffic between different network segments, creating a more complex and robust network topology.

### Phase 4: Advanced LAN Configuration

The final phase involved deploying various network services, including a web server, DNS, and DHCP. This phase built upon the previous phases by adding essential network services to support the network's operation and management.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Kotlin**: Used for developing the HTTP/s client.
- **XAMPP/Apache**: Used as the server for handling HTTP/s requests.
- **Wireshark**: Used for analyzing network traffic.
- **Networking Hardware**: Routers, switches, and other devices for setting up the LAN.

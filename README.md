#Computer Networking Reports

Computer Networking Curricular Unit (Computer Engineering Bachelor)

In this repository I have my 4 reports made in the second semester of Computer Engineering Degree.
These reports were evaluated with a 18.25 out of 20 grades in my practical aspect of the "Computer Networking" class.

In each directory there is the Report of the Project Phase.

On the 1st phase I made an HTTP/s Client in Kotlin. Using XAMPP/Apache server we made some HTTP/s Requests and then analyzed them using Wireshark

From the phase 2 to phase 4 we went on configuring a small LAN network with a base networking topology.

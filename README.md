# Networking Reports

Computer Networking Curricular Unit (Computer Engineering Bachelor)
In this repository I have my 4 reports made in the second semester of Computer Engineering Graduation.
These reports were evaluated with a 18.25 out of 20 grades in my practical aspect of the "Computer Networking" class.

In each directory there is the Report of the Project Phase.

In the first phase I was aiming to analyze how HTTP requests and replies happen while also analyzing the correlation with TCP
For this phase we used XAMPP/Apache, Kotlin to create a client without http libraries and Wireshark.

From the phase 2 to phase 4 we went on configuring a small LAN network with a base networking topology.

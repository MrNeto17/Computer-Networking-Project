# HttpProject
On this project I was aiming to study the behavior of HTTP Server and Clients. I used XAMPP/Apache as a web server first and our browser as client. After that i've made a HTTP Client in Kotlin without using any HTTP Libraries to replace the browser.
Finally we sent some requests using both (browser client and kotlin client) and captured it using WireShark to analyze the server-client communication.

The Report of this Project is present on the repository.

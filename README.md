# Networking Reports

Computer Networking Curricular Unit (Computer Engineering Bachelor)
In this repository I have my 4 reports made in the second semester of Computer Engineering Graduation.
These reports where evaluated with a 18.25 out of 20 grade in my pratical aspect of the "Computer Networking" class.

In each Phase directory there is the report those phases and also the assignment.

On the first phase I was aiming to analyze how HTTP requests and replys happen while also analyzing the correlation with TCP
For this phase we used XAMPP/Apache, Kotlin to create a client without http libraries and wireshark.

From the phase 2 to phase 4 we went on configuring a small LAN network with a base networking topollogy.
